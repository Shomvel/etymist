English translate
From Middle English translaten (“to transport, translate, transform”) [and other forms],[1] and then from:

Anglo-Norman tranlater, translater, and Middle French, Old French translater (“to translate from one language into another; to move something from one place to another; to transfer a bishop from one see to another; to relocate (a saint's relics)”) (modern French translater); and
their etymon Latin trānslātus (“carried, conveyed; handed over; transferred”), the perfect passive participle of trānsferō (“to bring or carry across or over, transfer, transport; to translate from one language to another; to use figurative; to change, transform”).[2]
Trānslātus is derived from trāns- (prefix meaning ‘beyond’) + lātus (“borne, carried”) (ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *telh₂- (“to bear, endure; to undergo”)), the irregular perfect passive participle of ferō (“to bear, carry”). The English word is cognate with Catalan traslladar (“to transfer”), Irish trasladar (“to move something from one place to another; to transfer; to translate”), Italian traslatare, Late Latin translatare (“to translate from one language into another; to transfer a bishop from one see to another; to relocate (a saint's relics); to transcribe”), Old Occitan transladar, translatar, traslatar, Portuguese transladar, trasladar (“to move something from one place to another; to translate”), Spanish trasladar, transladar (“to move; to transfer; to translate; to copy, transcribe; to transmit”).[2]

The word displaced Middle English awenden (“to change; to translate”) (from Old English āwendan), Middle English irecchen (“to explain, expound, interpret”) (from Old English ġereċċan), and Old English ġeþēodan (“to engage in; to translate”).

"Trānslātus is derived... " is considered note. and then
and their etymon 
(the word displaced -> extract reference)

Latin fero
A suppletive paradigm consisting of two different roots.

The present stem is from Proto-Italic *ferō, from Proto-Indo-European *bʰéreti (“to bear, carry”), from the root *bʰer-. Cognates include Sanskrit भरति (bhárati), Persian بار‎ (bâr), Old Armenian բերեմ (berem), Ancient Greek φέρω (phérō), Old English beran (English bear).

The perfect stem, originally of tollō, is from Proto-Italic *tetolai, from Proto-Indo-European *tetólh₂e (“to be holding up”), from the root *telh₂-. The stem of lātus has the same root, reduced from Proto-Italic *tlātos, from Proto-Indo-European *tl̥h₂tós. It is cognate with English thole (“to endure”).

From Middle English perfit, from Old French parfit (modern: parfait), from Latin perfectus, perfect passive participle of perficere (“to finish”), from per- (“through, thorough”) + facere (“to do, to make”). Spelling modified 15c. to conform to Latin etymology. Doublet of parfait.
